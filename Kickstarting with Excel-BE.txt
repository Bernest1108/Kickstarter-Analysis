# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview of Project
*This project is an analysis of a robust Kickstarter data set. 
High level goal is applying past transactions to future funding trends.
 


## Purpose
*We are providing our client Louise with a historical analysis of campaign transactions to increase her chance of success.  


### Analysis and Challenges
*My analysis of a data set spanning 8 years may confidently be used to make an informed campaign decision. (https://github.com/Bernest1108/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge%202.0%20ZIP.zip).
Challenges encountered and overcome in the analysis were related to  the conversion of Unix timestamps.     

 


### Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 *Highest volume of campaigns are launched within April, May, June and July.
 *The highest success rate was within the month May at 67%.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 *Lower goal amounts trend towards a higher percentage of success.   


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 *Not knowing the geographic location beyond country of origin.
 *Elements that may have contributed to the outcome outside of achieving the dollar goal. 
 *Kickstarter is the only source for data set. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 *Outcome based on blurb topic.
